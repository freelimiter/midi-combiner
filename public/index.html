      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <strong>MIDI Combiner</strong> is a powerful, easy-to-use web app built especially for BeatBuddy pedal users.<br />
        Upload your MIDI part files—<em>each with their own tracks</em>—and seamlessly combine them into a single, ready-to-load multi-part MIDI song file.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Upload MIDI Part Files:</strong><br />
          Drag and drop your BeatBuddy part MIDIs (Intro, Main, Fill, Outro, etc.), or select them from your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reorder &amp; Customize:</strong><br />
          Arrange the order of your MIDI files using drag-and-drop.<br />
          For each part, choose how many times it should repeat in your final song.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combine and Download:</strong><br />
          With one click, the app merges <em>all tracks and events from all files</em> in your selected order and repetitions.<br />
          The combined multi-track MIDI file is ready to import into BeatBuddy Manager or use with your pedal.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Who Is This For?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>BeatBuddy users &amp; song creators:</strong> Merge and arrange drum parts, fills, and song sections easily—no DAW needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Everything runs locally in your browser—no upload, no sign-up, no install.<br />
        Works on any modern computer or tablet.</em>
      </p>
